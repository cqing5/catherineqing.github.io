## Tech for Social Good

I am passionate about the use of computational methods to answer social science questions and tech for social good! I collaborate with numerous Indigenous communities across North America on projects and tools to preserve and revitalize their languages. Excitingly, I recently worked with the Arctic Village Council in Alaska to secure a large federal grant funding our project to create a variety of resources for the Dinjii Zhuh KÊ¼yÃ a language, including the training and development of AI software for translationðŸ¥³ 

## Education
I am also passionate about **equal-access education** and making knowledge universally available. As a result, I've worked with [SureStart](https://mysurestart.com/) and [Infogito](https://www.linkedin.com/company/infogito) in the edtech space to make STEM education more accessible to K-12 students who come from backgrounds historically underrepresented in STEM fields. Here is a [list of resources](https://collegeeducated.com/resources/diversity-and-equity-in-stem/) to support and learn more about diversity and equity in STEM!
