## About Me
I just graduated from Stanford University my M.S. in Symbolic Systems, an interdisciplinary program combining several fields, including computer science, psychology, and linguistics. At Stanford, I worked with [Hyowon Gweon](https://sll.stanford.edu) to investigate adaptive communication in children and children's social networks. I also worked with Hazel Markus, Jennifer Eberhardt, and MarYam Hamedani at [Stanford SPARQ](https://sparq.stanford.edu) to investigate how people understand and respond to social and economic inequality.

Before I came to Stanford, I earned my B.S. in Psychology and Informatics from Indiana University in 2022, where I also received a Certificate in Clinical Psychological Science. As an undergraduate, I studied biased perceptions of low-socioeconomic status individuals with [Kurt Hugenberg](https://hugenberg.lab.indiana.edu/index.html), as well as gender roles and motivation with [Amanda Diekman](https://socialroles.lab.indiana.edu/index.html).

I am passionate about the use of computational methods in research and tech for social good! I collaborate with numerous Indigenous communities across North America on projects and tools to preserve and revitalize their languages. Excitingly, a large federal grant was just awarded to the Arctic Village Council in Alaska for our project to create a variety of resources for the Dinjii Zhuh KÊ¼yÃ a language, including the training and development of AI software for translationðŸ¥³ I am also passionate about education, especially equal-access education. As a result, I've worked with [SureStart](https://mysurestart.com/) and [Infogito](https://www.linkedin.com/company/infogito) in the edtech space to make STEM education more accessible to K-12 students who come from backgrounds historically underrepresented in STEM fields.

## Outside of Academia
I grew up and spent almost my entire life in Indiana, and contrary to many Californians' beliefs, I loved it! I miss the Midwest often, but I am also so grateful to have had the opportunity to live in and experience the Bay Area. Specifically, I love eating my way around the Bay and rating all of my eats (follow me on Beli! @catcrossing). Having assimilated to the Bay rather quickly, I also enjoy hiking and going on walksâ€”being from the astonishingly flat Indiana, I don't think I will ever get enough of the mountains and views here. You can also find me playing badminton (which I just picked up this summer yet still delusionally think that I could make it to the 2028 Olympics) and at the gym!
