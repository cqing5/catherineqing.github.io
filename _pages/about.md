I just graduated from Stanford University with my [M.S. in Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/graduates/masters-program), an interdisciplinary program combining several fields, including computer science, psychology, and linguistics. At Stanford, I worked with [Hyowon Gweon](https://sll.stanford.edu) to investigate adaptive communication in children and children's social networks. I also worked with Hazel Markus, Jennifer Eberhardt, and MarYam Hamedani at [Stanford SPARQ](https://sparq.stanford.edu), studying how people understand and respond to social and economic inequality.

Before I came to Stanford, I earned my B.S. in Psychology and Informatics from Indiana University in 2022, where I also received a Certificate in Clinical Psychological Science. As an undergraduate, I studied biased perceptions of low-socioeconomic status individuals with [Kurt Hugenberg](https://hugenberg.lab.indiana.edu/index.html), as well as gender roles and motivation with [Amanda Diekman](https://socialroles.lab.indiana.edu/index.html). 

## Research Interests
Combining my interests in developmental and social psychology, I aim to investigate how promoting structural thinking in children could foster more nuanced perspectives that recognize the role of social, historical, and structural factors in creating and perpetuating inequalities and ultimately drive positive societal change. Much of my research at SPARQ has shown that many adults in the U.S. struggle to recognize the role that structural factors play in racial and socioeconomic inequalities (e.g., wealth gap, achievement gap). As a result, I hope to explore methods and interventions that can foster structural thinking in children—in particular, I'm curious about how different narratives and language we use to describe inequalities can shift children’s thinking about such differences. I'm also interested in how children come to understand societal disparities in the first place, including how they reason about social systems/structures, groups, and roles. 


## For Fun!
I grew up and spent almost my entire life in Indiana, and contrary to many Californians' beliefs, it was amazing! I miss the Midwest often, but I am also so grateful to have had the opportunity to live in and experience the Bay Area. Specifically, I love eating my way around the Bay and rating all of my eats (follow me on Beli! @catcrossing). Having quickly conformed to the norms here, I now also enjoy hiking—being from the astonishingly flat Indiana, I don't think I will ever get enough of the mountains and views here. You can also find me playing badminton (which I just picked up this summer yet delusionally think that I could still make it to the 2028 Olympics), at the gym, and at music festivals!
